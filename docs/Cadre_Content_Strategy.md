# Content Strategy: Seeding "Hiring Activity Intelligence" as a Category

**Goal:** By the time the fund product launches, GPs and fund ops teams should already associate Cadre with hiring activity intelligence. The category should feel inevitable, not invented.

---

## The Playbook

Category creation follows a specific sequence: name it → define it → prove it with data → get others to use the phrase. You don't announce a category. You demonstrate it exists through consistent, data-driven content that makes people think "why didn't this exist before?"

---

## Phase 1: Demonstrate the Data (March-April 2026)

Before you say the words "hiring activity intelligence," show the insights it produces. Let the audience discover the category through the data itself.

### LinkedIn Posts (2-3x per week)

**Format: Data insight + one-line interpretation + link to cadre.careers**

Example posts:

**Post type: Portfolio Pulse**
> Sequoia's portfolio posted 89 new roles this week.
> 60% engineering. 25% sales. 15% everything else.
> When a portfolio shifts from building to selling, you can see it in the hiring data before it shows up in revenue.
> Full breakdown → cadre.careers

**Post type: Fundraise-to-Hiring**
> Companies that raised Series B in January have posted an average of 31 roles within 45 days.
> The fastest: [Company] — 47 roles posted in 3 weeks.
> The slowest: [Company] — zero new postings 60 days post-raise.
> What does hiring velocity tell you about execution? More than any quarterly update.

**Post type: Function Mix Shift**
> Across 1,300 VC-backed companies this month:
> Engineering hiring: flat (+2%)
> Sales hiring: up 34%
> Product design: up 41%
> The market is shifting from build mode to ship-and-sell mode.

**Post type: Stall Signal**
> 47 companies in our database have posted zero new roles in the last 90 days.
> 12 of them raised rounds in the last 6 months.
> Hiring stalls after a fundraise are one of the earliest signals something is off.

**Post type: Emerging Company**
> These 5 companies went from 0 to 20+ open roles in 30 days:
> [Company 1] — Series A, AI infrastructure
> [Company 2] — Seed, robotics
> [Company 3] — Series B, cybersecurity
> ...
> All raised in Q4. The hiring wave is starting.

**Key rules:**
- Every post contains at least one original data point derived from Cadre's database
- Never tag companies or people in Weeks 1-4 (build credibility before drawing attention)
- Every post links back to cadre.careers
- Data should feel fresh and specific — not generic market commentary
- Avoid saying "hiring activity intelligence" yet — let the data speak first

### Newsletter: The Cadre Hiring Signal (Weekly, Saturday mornings)

**5 sections:**

1. **THE SIGNAL** — One headline stat with 2-3 sentences of context. "Series B AI companies added 340 roles this week — up 22% from last month."

2. **PORTFOLIO PULSE** — Three investor portfolios, total role counts, top hiring companies. "a16z portfolio: 142 new roles. Top: Anthropic (23), [Company] (18), [Company] (12)."

3. **FRESH FUNDRAISES** — Companies that raised this week + immediate role counts. Links to cadre.careers company pages.

4. **HOT ROLES** — Five curated listings with investor context. "VP Engineering at [Company] — Series B, led by Founders Fund. This team just tripled their engineering org."

5. **ONE THING** — A single insight or trend observation. "This week, 38% of all new postings were for remote roles. Down from 44% three months ago. The office pull-back is showing up in the data."

## Phase 2: Name the Category (May-June 2026)

Once the audience is trained to expect data-driven hiring insights from Cadre, introduce the category explicitly.

### The Naming Post (LinkedIn)

> We've been publishing weekly hiring data from 1,300+ VC-backed companies for three months. Here's what I've learned:
>
> Financial metrics tell you where a company has been. Hiring activity tells you where it's going.
>
> A company posting 15 engineering roles is building. 10 sales roles means they're scaling. Zero postings for 90 days? Something changed.
>
> This data exists in public — every careers page, every ATS feed. But nobody has structured it, organized it by investor backing, or made it queryable at portfolio scale.
>
> We call it Hiring Activity Intelligence — the most forward-looking operational signal in the venture ecosystem.
>
> It's what your LP reports are missing. It's what your portfolio reviews should include. It's what Cadre was built to provide.

### Supporting Content Pieces

**Blog post / LinkedIn article:** "Why Hiring Activity Is the Leading Indicator VCs Aren't Tracking"
- LP reports track revenue, burn, runway — all lagging indicators
- Hiring activity is the earliest public signal of strategic intent
- Data examples from Cadre's database proving the correlation
- Position Cadre as the source of this intelligence

**Blog post:** "What Sequoia's Portfolio Hiring Tells You That Their LP Letter Doesn't"
- Anonymize if needed, or use aggregate data
- Show the gap between narrative ("portfolio is executing well") and data (actual hiring patterns)
- Introduce the concept of hiring velocity as a portfolio health metric

**Blog post:** "The 5 Hiring Signals Every VC Should Monitor in Their Portfolio"
1. Hiring velocity (rate of new postings over time)
2. Function mix shift (building vs. selling)
3. Stall signals (zero postings for 60+ days)
4. Surge signals (3x+ average posting rate)
5. Time-roles-stay-open (proxy for hiring difficulty / employer brand strength)

This post becomes the canonical definition of the category. Link to it from everything.

## Phase 3: Own the Category (July+ 2026)

### Recurring Content Formats

**Monthly Hiring Activity Report** — comprehensive, data-heavy analysis of VC-ecosystem hiring trends. Published as a Cadre-branded report (PDF or long-form post). This becomes the thing people cite and share. The "State of Hiring Activity Intelligence" report.

**Quarterly LP-Ready Portfolio Summaries** — even before Product 2 launches, publish anonymous aggregate data: "Here's what Q1 hiring activity looked like across the top 50 VC portfolios." Fund ops people see this and think "I want this for MY portfolio specifically." That's the upgrade path to Product 2.

### Conference / Event Presence

- Pitch hiring activity intelligence at LP/GP conferences (ILPA events, VC summit panels)
- Offer to present data at VC firm portfolio review meetings (free — this is your sales motion for Product 2)
- Guest on VC-focused podcasts with data insights

### SEO/GEO Play

- Own "hiring activity intelligence" as a search term (you'll likely be the only result for months)
- Publish content targeting "[VC firm] portfolio jobs" and "[VC firm] portfolio hiring" search queries
- Every company page, investor page, and job page on cadre.careers has structured data (JSON-LD) that AI crawlers and search engines index

## Voice & Tone

- **Data-first.** Every post leads with a specific number or insight. Never generic commentary.
- **Confident but not promotional.** You're sharing intelligence, not selling a product. The product sells itself when people want more depth than a LinkedIn post can provide.
- **Insider perspective.** Write like you have access to data others don't — because you do. Not arrogant, but authoritative.
- **Concise.** LinkedIn posts: 50-150 words max. Let the data do the talking.
- **Never use:** "game-changing," "disruptive," "revolutionary," "unlock," or any other startup cliché.
- **Always use:** specific numbers, specific company/investor names (when public and positive), and "hiring activity" as the consistent framing.

## The Endgame

When a GP is preparing for a portfolio review and thinks "I should check the hiring data" — they should think of Cadre. When an LP asks "how is the portfolio executing?" and a GP pulls up a Cadre dashboard instead of a spreadsheet — the category is won. When an AI recruiting agent needs structured hiring data and calls the Cadre API — the business is built.

It starts with three LinkedIn posts a week and a Saturday morning email. The category grows from there.
